Hello Bisi,

It was nice to hear from you. Thank you for inviting me for futher interviews with Bloomberg.

I already applied for the UK visa (on 3rd October) as I am visiting London from 29th October to 2nd November for my onsite interviews with Facebook, London scheduled on 30th October. So, it will be convenient for me to take my in-house interviews with Bloomberg between 1st November and 5th November.

Once I receive my visa, I'll also  make sure to forward it to you. My travel location / arrangement will depend on the interview date so if it would be better if we first finalise the interview date. I will share the necessary details related to my travel and stay, as soon as possible in follow up to that.

I'd also like to mention that I have a pre-placement offer for a full time Software Engineering position with Intuit and have scheduled interviews with Nutanix.

I'd really appreciate if you could consider my request and have my interviews scheduled on one of the above mentioned dates. Thank you!

Sincerely,
Swapnil Gupta
